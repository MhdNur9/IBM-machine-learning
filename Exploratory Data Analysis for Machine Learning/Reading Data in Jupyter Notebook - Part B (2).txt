# Create a variable, `path`, containing the path to the `baseball.db` contained in `resources/`
path = 'data/baseball.db'

# Create a connection, `con`, that is connected to database at `path`
con = sq3.Connection(path)

# Create a variable, `query`, containing a SQL query which reads in all data from the `` table

query = """
SELECT *
    FROM allstarfull
    ;
"""

allstar_observations = pd.read_sql(query, con)

# print(allstar_observations)

# Create a variable, tables, which reads in all data from the table sqlite_master
all_tables = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM sqlite_master', con)
print(all_tables)

# Pretend that you were interesting in creating a new baseball hall of fame. Join and analyze the tables to evaluate the top 3 all time best baseball players
