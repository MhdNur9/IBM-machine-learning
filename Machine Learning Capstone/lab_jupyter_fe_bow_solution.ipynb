Similar to BoW, the tf-idf also counts the word frequencies in each document. Furthermore, tf-idf will  offset the number of documents in the corpus that contain the word in order to adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general. The higher the tf-idf normally means the greater the importance the word/token is.\n","- **Text embedding vector**. Embedding means projecting an object into a latent feature space. We normally employ neural networks or deep neural networks to learn the latent features of a textual object such as a word, a sentence, or the entire document. The learned latent feature vectors will be used to represent the original textual entities. \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"42e466ac-0b96-438e-82be-058905cc2511","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["### Summary\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0ad3b588-9f7d-470a-8152-27a9a167b669","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["Congratulations, you have completed the BoW feature extraction lab.
